# LammpsSlimeNetwork
First, our networks were produced by the slime mold algorithm hosted on the following website: https://github.com/nicoptere/physarum 

Then, we used the python code titled “NetworkConversion.py” to convert the images into atomic coordinates in the format of LAMMPS

Finally, we input our coordinate data into a modified version of network.lam we provided. The image output was converted to a movie in imageJ to analyze the results.

Please note, our file had too many atoms to properly display and required modified the zoom value to properly view the individual atoms.
